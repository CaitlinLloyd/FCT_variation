# FCT_variation

This rating task is based on the FCT that was developed by Dr. Karin Foerde and Dr. Joanna Steinglass and updated by Serena Gu and Xinwei Samantha Han (described in Steinglass et al., 2015).
It includes a food choice task that it optimized for multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) and a separate behavioral rating task that assesses perception of nutrient content (based on the task described by Suzuki et al., 2017).
